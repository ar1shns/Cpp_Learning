# C++ Learning - DSA from Basics to Advanced

Welcome to my C++ Learning repository! This repository serves as a personal learning space where I explore C++ programming, along with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from the basics to advanced levels. Each section contains code implementations of various topics as I progress in my learning journey.

## ðŸ“š Contents

1. **Basic C++ Programs**  
   Simple programs to get started with C++ syntax, variables, loops, functions, and more.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
   Exploring OOP principles like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in C++.

3. **Data Structures**  
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
   - Graphs

4. **Algorithms**  
   - Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
   - Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
   - Greedy Algorithms
   - Dynamic Programming
   - Backtracking

5. **Advanced C++ Concepts**  
   Topics such as templates, STL (Standard Template Library), and memory management in C++.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To explore the code in this repository, simply clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ar1shns/Cpp_Learning.git
```

You can navigate through the folders for different topics and run the programs to see how they work.
